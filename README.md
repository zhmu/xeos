# XeOS

XeOS (pronounced as _chaos_) is my attempt to create a stable, solid microkernel. It was mostly for research and development purposes, and designed to be easy to understand, extend and generally, to play around with.

## Features
 
 * True pre-emptive multitasking
 * Microkernel architecture
 * Support for ELF executables
 * Tiny libc-like general library
 * Basic IPv4 functionality
 * NE2000 NIC support
 * IDE support
 * FAT16 support
